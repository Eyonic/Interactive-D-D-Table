How It Works:
Run the Python script on your PC.

It will prompt you to upload:

Background map (Image or Video).

Background music for the map.

9 sound effects for the map.

It will overlay the grid on the background map, and you can choose whether to use a hexagonal or square grid.

The final output is saved as an image (and optionally converted to video).
