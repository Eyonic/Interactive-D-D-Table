Raspberry Pi Zero – 10-Button Interactive Soundboard with Live Map Display

Overview:
This project uses a Raspberry Pi Zero with a 10-button interface to display a live map and play background music. It allows the user to switch between different "map sets" and trigger sound effects, all while maintaining smooth audio and visual feedback.

Features:

Live map display (GIF or video format)

Background music auto-starts with each map

Dynamic sound effect buttons (with volume ducking)

Map and sound set selection via dedicated button

Button Layout:

Button 0: "Set" button – used to select a map and corresponding audio set

Buttons 1–9: Sound effect triggers (1 per button)

Usage Logic:

Press Button 0 (Set) followed by Button X (1–9) to load Map X.

The system:

Displays the associated map (as a looping video or animated GIF)

Overlays a grid of hexagons with correct aspect ratio (predefined via PC)

Plays the designated background music for that map

Loads sound effects mapped to Buttons 1–9 for that specific set

Sound Effect Behavior:

When any sound effect button (1–9) is pressed:

Background music volume is reduced ("ducked")

The sound effect is played

Background music returns to normal volume after playback
