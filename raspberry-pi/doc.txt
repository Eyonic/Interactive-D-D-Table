Explanation:
GPIO Setup:

The script uses the RPi.GPIO library to listen for button presses.

Button 0 (Set) changes the map, while Buttons 1-9 trigger the sound effects.

Media Management:

Video: We use omxplayer to display a looping video on the TV using the Raspberry Piâ€™s micro HDMI port.

Audio: pygame.mixer handles the background music and sound effects. Music is "ducked" when a sound effect is played, lowering its volume temporarily.

Map Set Switching:

When Button 0 is pressed, followed by any other button, it triggers a map switch (load_set()) to load new media (map and audio).

Sound Effect Logic:

Each map has 9 sound effects. When any of the SFX buttons (1-9) is pressed, it plays the corresponding sound effect (play_sfx()), temporarily lowering the background music volume.

Continuous Operation:

The script continuously listens for button presses, updating the media accordingly.
